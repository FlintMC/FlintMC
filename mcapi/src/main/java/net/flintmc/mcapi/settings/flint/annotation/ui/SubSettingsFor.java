 * Defines {@link ApplicableSetting}s in a {@link Config} to be sub settings of another {@link
 * ApplicableSetting}.
 *
 * <p>The class where the with {@link SubSettingsFor} annotated interface is located has to be
 * either an inner class of the class where the parent setting is defined or {@link #declaring()}
 * has to return the class where the parent setting is defined.
 *
 * <p>Example of a parent setting with sub settings:
 *
 * <pre>
 *
 * <literal>@</literal>BooleanSetting
 * boolean getSomeParent();
 *
 * SubSettings getSubSettings();
 *
 * <literal>@</literal>SubSettingsFor("SomeParent")
 * interface SubSettings {
 *
 *   <literal>@</literal>StringSetting
 *   String getSomeSubSetting();
 *
 * }
 *
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>This would mark everything in the SubSettings interface as a sub setting of getParent.
 *
 * <p>If a setting is already a sub setting of a setting, no other settings can be the sub setting
 * of this setting. Sub settings cannot have sub settings.
