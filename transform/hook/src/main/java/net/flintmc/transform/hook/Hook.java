/**
 * Allows for adding code to methods in compiled classes. The annotated method will then be fired

 * {@link #className() defined class} is fired. <br>
 * <br>
 * If the annotated method has a return type that is not {@code void}, this doesn't just fire the
 * annotated method, but cancels further execution of this method. However, this does only work if
 * the {@link #methodName() hooked method} doesn't have the return type {@code void} OR the return
 * type of the annotated method is {@link HookResult}.
 *
 * <p>If the result of the annotated method is not {@link HookResult} and not {@code void}, the
 * exact result (which may also be {@code null}) will be returned in the {@link #methodName() hooked
 * method}.
 *
 * <p>If it is {@link HookResult}, see the values in {@link HookResult} for more information about
 * what will happen in the method. <br>
 *
 * <p>The annotated method can have any parameters from the Injector, but also the following
 * parameters:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@literal @}Named("instance") Object instance - The instance where the hooked method has
 *       been fired, if the hooked method is static, this won't be available
 *   <li>{@literal @}Named("args") Object[] args - An array with all parameters that have been
 *       passed to the hooked method
 *   <li>{@link ExecutionTime} time - The execution time when the method has been fired
